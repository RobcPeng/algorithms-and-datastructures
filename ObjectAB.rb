=begin
Given an array of object A, and an array of object B. All A's have 
different sizes, and all B's have different sizes. Any object A is of the 
same size as exactly one object B. We have a function f(A, B) to compare the 
size of one A and one B. But we cannot compare between two A's or two B's. 
Give an algorithm to match each A with each B.=end
